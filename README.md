# Classification-of-Pathological-Heartbeat

This study proposes a novel approach for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification using convolutioni neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning. The model was pre-trained on a dataset of aggregated ECG signals to capture global patterns and fine-tuned on individual patient data. The MIT-BH Arrhythmia Database was utilized for training and evaluation. Results show that patient-specific models achieved an average balanced accuracy of 94.6%, while transfer learning-based models reached 93.5%. Although patient-specific models demonstrated slightly better performance, transfer learning offered significant advantages in data-scarce scenarios. This study highlights the potential of transfer learning in addressing challenges such as data scarcity and inter-patient variability in ECG classification.
